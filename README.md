#  A Web Application for Dog Kennel Owners

А web application designed to help dog kennel owners efficiently manage information about their dogs and litters.
This is my graduation project. It is a web application for dog kennel owners. To keep records of kennel dogs and puppies (for example, treatments, puppies born, etc.)


The project is based on the Sakai template from the PrimeNG library and PrimeNG components are also used.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
